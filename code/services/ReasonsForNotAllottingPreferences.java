		/* The seven possible reasons for not getting allotted a valid preference is
		 * 2. Class constraint satisfied by courses which were ranked higher by student
		 * 3. The set of core courses and elective courses which were ranked higher by this student fill up the credit requirement,
		 *    and this course does not fit in the remaining credits
		 * 4. Course is full
		 * 6. Course with same colour code already allotted, which was ranked lower by student (will not occour for IterativeHR, firstPreferenceAllotment. Can occour for slotBasedHR)
		 * 7. The set of core courses and elective courses which were ranked lower by student (will not occour for IterativeHR, firstPreferenceAllotment. Can occour for slotBasedHR) fill up the credit requirement,
		 *    and this course does not fit in the remaining credits
		 *    
		 * Note that the order of this check must be maintained because of these points.
		 * a) Reason 1 to 3 can be permuted among themselves and it will be okay.
		 * b) Reason 4 must be checked after Reason 1,2,3 because of the following. If a 
		 *    student is not allotted course c1 because of one of the reasons (1,2,3), but the course
		 *    ends up full and Reason 4 is reported because it was checked first, it could be a problem. 
		 *    If the student knows that c1 ranks him/her well according to its ranking criteria (say CGPA), and
		 *    other students in his class with a lower CGPA got the course, then reading the 
		 *    Reason 4 will make him think that the allotment is unfair. Hence in the presence
		 *    of Reason 1,2,3 being true for not allotting, Reason 4 should not be stated as 
		 *    a reason.
		 * c) Reason 5,6,7 can permuted among themselves.
		 * d) Reason 5,6,7 must come after Reason 1,2,3,4. If a student is told Reason 5,6,7 
		 * 	  for not getting allotted course c1, in the presence of Reason 1,2,3,4 being true,
		 *    then the student may find it unfair. For example if course c1 was not allotted
		 *    because of Reason 4, and you state reason 5 (even reason 5 is true),
		 *    the student will question why a lower ranked course is blocking his higher
		 *    rank course. But the truth is that the course became full. Another example is 
		 *    if both Reason 2 and 5 are true, the student will find Reason 2 to be a better
		 *    explanation than Reason 5. And in this case it was probably Reason 2 that 
		 *    was the actual cause in the algorithm
		 * e) Reason 5,6,7 seem like they will not occur, but they can in the case of slot 
		 *    based HR, where we may first pick a slot which has low ranked courses 
		 *    for a student, and his low rank courses may block (by slot,colour,credits) a
		 *    higher ranked course. This problem will not occour in IterativeHR and 
		 *    FirstPreferenceAllotment
		 * f) Reason 0 must come first for obvious reasons.  
		 *

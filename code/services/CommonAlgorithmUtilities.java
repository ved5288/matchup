/**
 * This Class is simply a collection of some common functions used by algorithms.
 * 1. ENSURE THAT THE SEMANTICS OF EACH FUNCTION IS UNDERSTOOD BEFORE YOU USE IT. 
 * 
 * 2. This was initially developed for the 3 iterative algorithms : IterativeHRalgorithm,FirstPreferenceAllotmentAlgorithm,SlotBasedHRalgorithm
 *    HENCE AVOID MAKING CHANGES TO THE ALREADY IMPLEMENTED METHODS SINCE IT MAY CAUSE ANY OF THESE 
 *    3 ALGORITHMS TO BREAK.
 *    Make changes to the methods only if you are absolutely sure that they have a bug or need changing,
 *    and will not break the previously implemented algorithms. If you need a functionality which is slightly
 *    different from any of the implemented functions, just implement a new function.
